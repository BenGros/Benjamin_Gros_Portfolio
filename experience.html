                As a summer student I had to learn the languages and tools used in the lab

            <p class="description"> Working as a team we designed a treat dispenser designed to be attached
                to the wheelchair of people with cerebral palsy so they could enjoy 
                being able to give their cat treats. The design consists of a storage container that is 
                easy to open and close, as well as a dispensing mechanism triggered by a buddy button.
